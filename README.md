    "* **Suggestion for choosing movie kinds from top 10 movies selection from the market.** There are top 10 movies from the market choice. Most of the movies are high level CG action and magic movies.\n",

    "* **Get the goals with vote average.** Most movies have vote average from 5 to 8 rating. If your movie fits in this goal, market tell you 'your movie is successful.'\n"
